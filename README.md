# Lung Nodule Classification 
### Project Overview
In this project our goal is to develop a Data Science-based solution to solve the problem of Lung Cancer Classification using Computerized Tomography (CT) Data. Lung cancer remains one of the most critical health challenges, and early, accurate detection plays a key role in improving patient outcomes. By leveraging machine learning models, this project aims to differentiate between benign and malignant lung nodules based on CT data.

### Data
The dataset consists of CT scan images from 1,010 patients. Each scan image includes detailed visual information that enables us to identify patterns associated with malignancy. Using feature extraction methods, we transform these images into a structured dataset, allowing for efficient analysis and model training.

# Project Roadmap
### 1. Feature Extraction

Notebook: feature.ipynb
Description: This notebook focuses on extracting relevant features from CT scan images, converting raw image data into structured features that can be analyzed and used in classification models.
Data Cleaning and Feature Selection

### 2. Data Cleaning and Feature Selection
Notebook: Lungcancer.ipynb
Description: After feature extraction, this step involves cleaning the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and other inconsistencies. We also use feature selection techniques like PCA and t-tests to identify the most relevant features for classification.
Model Implementation and Evaluation

### 3. Model Implementation and Evaluation
Notebook: Lungcancer.ipynb
Description: This notebook includes the implementation of machine learning models, including SVM, Random Forest, and an ensemble model. Hyperparameter tuning with Grid Search and model evaluation are also performed here, prioritizing sensitivity for accurate detection of malignant cases.
Results

### 4. Results
Notebook: Lungcancer.ipynb
Description: The final results are analyzed and visualized, with a focus on metrics like AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. This step highlights the modelâ€™s effectiveness in distinguishing between benign and malignant nodules.
